# Mod creation process

I gave the AI 46 edits before I got the result I wanted. I could have fixed it all myself much faster, but I really wanted the AI to do all the work of modification, albeit under my careful supervision. 

The most common errors made by ChatGPT were as follows:

- Incorrect or obsolete function names;
- Forgetting previous changes. I had to double-check the submitted code each time, or ask to send only a separate piece of code that had been changed;
- Confusing game concepts. For example, at first he did not understand the difference between the 3D portal marker and the blip on the game map.

To create at least some effect of real time travel, the AI added a little passphrase at my request: if you punch 2004 while playing as Michael, it will move to North Yankton.

# Important warning
